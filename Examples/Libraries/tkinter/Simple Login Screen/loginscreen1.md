Simple Description Of The Library From The [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter)
> CustomTkinter is a python UI-library based on Tkinter, which provides new, modern and fully customizable widgets. They are created and used like normal Tkinter widgets and can also be used in combination with normal Tkinter elements. The widgets and the window colors either adapt to the system appearance or the manually set mode ('light', 'dark'), and all CustomTkinter widgets and windows support HighDPI scaling (Windows, macOS). With CustomTkinter you'll get a consistent and modern look across all desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## How To Use The Example/CustomTkinter

First, you need to make sure you have the [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter) library. To get it, type this in the Command Prompt/Terminal ```pip install customtkinter``` to get the library.

Then, in your project, you should have a ```main.py``` welcome file/script already. If you don't have a file in your project, then right click your main file space (usually on the left, and press new to make a file, then name it whatever you want, but remember to write ```.py``` after the file name. ***(Shortcut is ```ctrl```+```alt```+```insert```)***

After you Python file is ready paste the code from [this file](Simple%20Login%20Screen/logincode1.py).

You can then customize the code as much as you need and implement it in your application.
